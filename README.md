# On-Board
A project to create an online board sharing website to help communicate visually through drawing.
We want to extend the typical idea of a whiteboard website to add the following features:
<ul type="disk">
  <li>wide variety of colours for background.</li>
  <li>wide varieties of colours for the pen.</li>
  <li>Insertion of custom images in the backgroud.</li>
  <li>insertion of google map as the background.</li>
  <li>Voice communication.</li>
  <li>At a later time we would also like to add an option to draw over videos.</li>
</ul>

All contribution and ideas,however small will be appreciated.
Thanks.
